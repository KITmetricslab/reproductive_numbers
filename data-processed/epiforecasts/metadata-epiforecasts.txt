Methods: 12-week rolling window; We used a log normal prior for the reproduction number (R₀) with mean 1 and standard deviation 0.2 reflecting our current belief that Rₜ is likely to be centred around 1 in most of the world, with public health interventions and individual behaviour combining to prevent it from growing significantly larger for sustained periods.
generation time: mean of 5.2 days, SD of 1.52 days
We forecast the time-varying effective reproduction number over a 14-day time horizon by assuming it remains the same as the last estimated Rₜ
