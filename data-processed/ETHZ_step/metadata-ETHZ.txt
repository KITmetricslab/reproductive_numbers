Methods: The reported Re for a given day is the mean Re over the last 3 days. We report the estimated median with the 95% uncertainty interval. The method to estimate Re is described here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.26.20239368v1.article-info. We build upon the existing EpiEstim method  to estimate Re(t) from a time series of infection incidence. To infer the infection incidence from a time series of (noisy) observations, we extended the deconvolution method by Goldstein et al. to deal with partially observed data and time-varying delay distributions. To reduce numerical artefacts resulting from the noisy nature of these observations, we smooth the data prior to deconvolution. We take into account uncertainty in the observation process using a bootstrap procedure, and in the Re estimation using the 95% highest posterior density intervals from EpiEstim. We further provide a 7-day estimate. This estimate is obtained by assuming a constant Re over the last seven days.
