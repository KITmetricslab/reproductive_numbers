methods: Arroyo-Marioli F, Bullano F, Kucinskas S, Rondón-Moreno C (2021) Tracking R of COVID-19: A new real-time estimation using the Kalman filter. PLoS ONE 16(1): e0244474. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244474 The method is based on the fact that in the SIR model, R is linearly related to the growth rate of the number of infected individuals. This time-varying growth rate is estimated using the Kalman filter from data on new cases. We estimate Rt by the Kalman smoother.
