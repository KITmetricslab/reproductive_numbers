# reproductive_numbers

This repository contains a colection of real-time R_t estimates by various research groups. See the subfolders of `data-processed` for the respective sources and licenses. This repository is required to run codes provided [here](https://github.com/ElisabethBrockhaus/Rt_estimate_reconstruction) to reproduce results from Brockhaus et al: Why are different estimates of the effective reproductive number so different? A case study on COVID-19 in Germany.

Structure of the repository:
- `data-processed` contains estimates in a standardized format.
- `data-raw` contains estimates in the format used by the respective research teams in their repositories.
- `code` contains codes used to translate form the original to the standardized format.
